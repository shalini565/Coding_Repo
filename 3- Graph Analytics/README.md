## Collaboration Recommendation and prediction of future collaborators for researchers
### Exploratory data analysis:
* Query a database for its schema
* Return and chart the number of node labels and relationship types using matplotlib.
* Build and plot a histogram of papers and their citations using pandas and matplotlib.
### Recommendation:
* Find potential collaborators for an author using page ranking
* Find relevant papers about a topic for an author using personalized page ranking.
### Prediction:
* Use the link prediction functions in Neo4j
* Build a link prediction classifier using scikit-learn with features derived from the Neo4j Graph Algorithms library
