For analysis and popularity prediction of YouTube videos, I took under consideration a dataset named as "Trending YouTube Video Statistics" from Kaggle. This dataset contains the details about YouTube videos for the years 2017 and 2018. Dataset included 10 CSVs each for a different country namely USA, Great Britain, Germany, Canada, France, Russia, Mexico, South Korea, Japan and India with up to 200 listed trending videos per day according to country-specific YouTube video data.
For preprocessing in data analysis we transformed the trending date to DateTime format and removed some of the columns like publish time, thumbnail link and video error or removed. We dropped the rows with missing values which are represented by ‘NaN’.For prediction it is required that our dataset values must be numerical. Hence, I opted for one-hot encoding to encode likes and dislikes. I also encoded views using python dictionary operations. Before encoding I had to categorize likes and dislikes into four categories i.e. VERY LOW, LOW, HIGH, VERY HIGH based on their respective column quartile values whereas for views column I categorized the values into HIGH and LOW. Our target variable for prediction model is ‘views’ which is now a binary variable after encoding. The factors which I took into consideration for building a prediction model are likes, category id, dislikes and day for trending. We used logistic regression for predicting popularity of video based on view count.
