For analysis and popularity prediction of YouTube videos, I took under consideration a dataset named as "Trending YouTube Video Statistics" from Kaggle. This dataset contains the details about YouTube videos for the years 2017 and 2018. Dataset included 10 CSVs each for a different country namely USA, Great Britain, Germany, Canada, France, Russia, Mexico, South Korea, Japan and India with up to 200 listed trending videos per day according to country-specific YouTube video data.
